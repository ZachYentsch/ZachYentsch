### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--I'm Zach! Welcome to my github profile.
I am currently 19, and I am working my way up to call myself a developer... yet. I am currently toward that goal by attending a Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp. Right now, I would call myself a hacker more than anything, although I would not say that in the traditional picture that media would paint of it. Although I don't fluently know any coding languages, I instead know enough to attempt to understand what I see. I end up looking at code for a long time, while attempting to try to understand what I am looking at. Then I try to hack something together, or bend it to my will. Most of my experience has come from many prior years of World of Warcraft and modifying addons in LUA to do what I want. I even tried my hand at it one time. It didn't end well.

Stuff to know about me:
I've contributed to open-source repositories for games like World of Warcraft and Rust. (Check out my pinned repos.)
I have 14 years experience in military(8) and law enforcement(6) fields.
I am a Hockey fan. San Jose Sharks & Idaho Steelheads
I am huge video game fan. I love exploring new worlds, and sometimes that is with other people.
I love gaming LAN parties and conventions.
My favorite things:
Hobbies: Spending time with my wife and son while we go camping, play games, spend the day at the water park, or just chill.
Games: Halo, Destiny & Cyberpunk 2077.
Movies: Back to the Future, Shawshank, Blade Runner, The Matrix, and the MCU.
Music: Rock, Metal & Synthwave.
